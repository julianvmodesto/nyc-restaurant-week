# nyc-restaurant-week

To help decide what restaurants to visit for NYC Restaurant Week.

My preferences are to try a restaurant with the following criteria:
* lunch M-F or Sunday
* a rating on Yelp >= 4 stars
* a high amount of Yelp reviews
* a non-fancy dress code

These translate to filters and sorts.
